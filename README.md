This repository was developed as part of a master's thesis exploring the detection and removal of banding artifacts in compressed videos to enhance visual quality. It features a novel neural network framework based on the HrNet algorithm (https://github.com/DarrenR96/HRNet_Implementation), trained with a perceptually motivated loss function incorporating the CAMBI metric. The larger project included a dataset of banding artifacts and an evaluation of the model's performance against state-of-the-art solutions using CAMBI and BBAND metrics. This work contributes to advancing video post-processing techniques for artifact removal.
